# TENNIS-GAME
The game is built in 3 ways: using DOM, SVG and Canvas.
The ball is jumping on the field, left and right racquets beat it off.
Ball launch is by the "start!" button. Ball fly straight out of the middle of the field in a random direction at a random angle.
Left racket is controlled with Shift (up) and Ctrl (down) keys,
The right racket is controlled with the up arrow and down arrow keys. As long as the key is down, the racket moves smoothly; the key is up - the racket stops.
If racket strikes ball - ball bounces off racket.
If the ball reaches the left or right wall - a goal is scored and until the next press "start!" the ball is stopped near the wall.
